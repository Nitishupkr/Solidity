# Decentralized FIR system
## Why do we need that ?
### First Information Report
FIR stands for First Information Report. It is a written document prepared by the police when they receive information about the commission of a cognizable offence. It is a report of information that reaches the police first in point of time and that is why it is called the First Information Report. Once an FIR has been filed the police are legally obligated to start investigating the case. The process of investigation includes, but is not limited to, collecting evidence, questioning witnesses, inspecting the crime scene, recording statements and forensic testing. In this modern world daily a lot of such incidents are noted and tons of FIR gets documented by the police department
## Why decentralize ?
Though the system is to be trusted as a citizen but papered documents are bound to lose value by the wrath of time. It may get worn and torn, may get misplaced and out of misfortune, a corrupt system may deliberately alter the status of the report. The prevailing solution digitalises FIR with the data collecting authority being still a centralized one instilling a similar fear of being unheard in case of a corrupt system or database failure. If not dishonesty, tragedy might also be caused by events of natural disaster or cyber attack which may disrupt the centralized system leading to malfunctioning and hence bring the whole proposed solution to a hault

Copy the code in remix IDE
You can also write the smart contract in replit IDE to deploy but here we'll be using the remix IDE to do the same<br/>
### Step 2:
Deploy the smart contract through remix IDE

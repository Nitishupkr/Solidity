# EVENT ORGANIZATION

## Description

It is a simple event organising contract.
It has two entities attendee and organisers.
organisers organize their event.
attandee can buy and transfer their tickets to other attendes.



## Tech Stack Used

I have used following tech stacks:-

- Solidity
- Remix

## Steps to Run

To run it, we just have to copy the smart contract into [Remix ide](https://remix.ethereum.org/), remix automatically compiles the contract. Then we to just deploy, smart contract's constructor doesn't take any arguments. After deployment we can mint nft using mintNft function. That's all.

## Funtions in the smart contract:-

- **ADD EVENT** :- A organiser can add multiple events but each event should satisfy some conditions.
 
- **BUY TICKET**:- allows attandee to to buy tickets which are listed by event organiser attandee can buy multiple tickets at a time.

- **TRANSFER TICKET** :- Transfers a ticket from one attendee to another user.

- **CHECK EVENTS** :- A attendee can check all listed evnts by multiple organisers and their available price etc.

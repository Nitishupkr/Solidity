Hi Solidity Learners ! 

The Pathshala this time comes up with another solidity program which takes input of two numbers and gives out the product of the numbers 

![Product_of_num](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193464088-09a4a85b-23a5-438e-88c4-ea95683bc065.png)

Let us Decode this :

- First line of code is always the SPDX License 
![SPDX-License](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193464211-712d633a-3c74-4937-99ad-54186c3c59ad.png)
License of Solidity program has a SPDX License which is a Software Package Data Exchange ( SPDX ), this license allows the expression of components, copyrights and security references 

- Pragma Solidity :

The First Line of Solidity Code has a pragma solidity , Pragma acts like a directive and it specifies the compiler verson we will be using for the program, in our addition program we are using 0.6.0 version. 

- Contract :

A contract is a fundamental block of building an application on Ethereum. We name the smart contract which we are going to build. 

- Function :
![function_mul](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193464548-a582ba2a-eb1e-4670-b14c-1d81cf8c39c5.png)
Here we go! 
Now we are writing a function - writing a function requires a gas since we are making a change on the blockchain 

- Deployed :

This is the interface, we get after depoloying the Smart Contract, Fill the numbers yo want to get the sum and hit the add button. 

- Result :
![Result_mul](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193464578-52c746a1-290b-4559-bf01-bfa821596474.png)
This is the result which we will get after running the smart contract 

Kudos ! We created our multiplication smart contract 

Happy Learning :)

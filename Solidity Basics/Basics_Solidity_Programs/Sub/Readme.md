Hi Solidity Learners ! 

The Pathshala this time comes up with another solidity program which takes input of two numbers and gives out the difference b/w the two numbers 
![sub_of_num](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193464980-1bd362d8-576a-4e5b-ba20-70d25a52dfd2.png)

Let us Decode this :

- First line of code is always the SPDX License 
![SPDX-License](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193464924-af949ea8-d2d5-481e-855f-fd38acd2bd91.png)
License of Solidity program has a SPDX License which is a Software Package Data Exchange ( SPDX ), this license allows the expression of components, copyrights and security references 

- Pragma Solidity :
![pragma_multiply](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193465098-3673d71d-d14e-4f28-a1e8-5d7efb70f1b0.png)

The First Line of Solidity Code has a pragma solidity , Pragma acts like a directive and it specifies the compiler verson we will be using for the program, in our addition program we are using 0.6.0 version. 

- Contract : 
![contract_Sub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193465070-c0585928-7919-4cc8-a1fe-cb4788951ce0.png)
A contract is a fundamental block of building an application on Ethereum. We name the smart contract which we are going to build. 

- Function :
![Function_Sub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89985553/193465082-9bab31e4-db5b-4b3a-87a3-b6111bb52710.png)

Here we go! 
Now we are writing a function - writing a function requires a gas since we are making a change on the blockchain 

- Deployed :

This is the interface, we get after depoloying the Smart Contract, Fill the numbers yo want to get the sum and hit the add button. 

- Result :

This is the result which we will get after running the smart contract 

Kudos ! We created our subtraction smart contract 

Happy Learning :)

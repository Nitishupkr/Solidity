Hi Solidity Learners ! 

This program is made to get the remainder, quotient and the divisor of two numbers

Contract : A contract is a fundamental block of building an application on Ethereum. We name the smart contract which we are going to build.

After nameing, we have to declare the variables data type, here we have integer type. We also need to declare the state of working which is specified by 'public' i.e public functions/ Variables can be used both externally and internally

This is the write up function, this function consumes gas - it is also showed in the right side of the image 

That's It, and we get our Smart Contract Ready, Let us Deploy it now

Fill the numbers you want to divide and smash the orange button

That's it ! 
We got our Division Program in Solidity Ready 

Happy Learning :)

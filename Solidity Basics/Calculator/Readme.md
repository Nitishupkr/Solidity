# Smart Contract "Calculator" in Remix-IDE

Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves. The Remix is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for creating smart contracts in Solidity. The Solidity code can be written, compiled, and debugged using the IDE.

## Getting Started :

### Step 1:

For opening the remix-ide in browser type: https://remix.ethereum.org/.

A screen will be presented like the following:

Click on the “file explorer” icon onto the left side bar.

Select Solidity in the Environment and click + symbol right to the browser.

Type the file name and enter the respective code into it.

### Step 2:

Now compile the Calculator.sol file,

### Step 3:

Once compiled successfully, click “Deploy and run transactions”. and "Deploy" it ,

### Step 4:

Click “>” before your contract you will see a button Calculator below as the contract has addition,multiplication,division and substractiono function that returns the ans of the number in getans.

Enter a two numbers and click the function whatever you want button and you will get the output in getans:

Now, we have successfully run the another smart contract in solidity.

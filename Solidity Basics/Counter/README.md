# Smart Contract "Counter" in Remix-IDE

Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves. The Remix is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for creating smart contracts in Solidity. The Solidity code can be written, compiled, and debugged using the IDE.


## Getting Started :

### Step 1:

For opening the remix-ide in browser type: https://remix.ethereum.org/.

A screen will be presented like the following:

Click on the “file explorer” icon onto the left side bar.

Select Solidity in the Environment and click + symbol right to the browser.

Type the file name  and enter the respective code into it.


### Step 2:
Now compile the Counter.sol file,

### Step 3:
Once compiled successfully,you can see the image with no errors

### Step 4:
Once compiled successfully, you can click deploy and run and you can see the function of counter Increment and Decrement and get Count functions

you can Increment , Decrement ,get the Total count.

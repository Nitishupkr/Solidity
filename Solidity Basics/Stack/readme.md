# Smart Contract "Stack Implementation" in Remix-IDE

## Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). Stacks are used to implement functions, parsers, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves. The Remix is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for creating smart contracts in Solidity. The Solidity code can be written, compiled, and debugged using the IDE.

## Stack Implementation:

### Step 1:

- Opening the remix-ide in browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/.

- Click on the “file explorer” icon onto the left side bar.

- Select Solidity in the Environment and click + symbol right to the browser.

- Type the file name and enter the Stack code into it.

### Step 2:

- Now compile the stack.sol file,

### Step 3:

Once compiled successfully, click “Deploy and run transactions”. and "Deploy" it ,

- pop(): Will remove the element present at the top of the stack
- push(): Add a new element at the top of the stack
- getSize(): Tells the current size of the stack
- top(): Returns the top of the stack

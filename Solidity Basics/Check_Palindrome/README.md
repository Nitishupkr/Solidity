# Smart Contract "Check Palindrome" in Remix-IDE

Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves. The Remix is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for creating smart contracts in Solidity. The Solidity code can be written, compiled, and debugged using the IDE.


## Getting Started :

### Step 1:

For opening the remix-ide in browser type: https://remix.ethereum.org/.

A screen will be presented like the following:

Click on the “file explorer” icon onto the left side bar.

Select Solidity in the Environment and click + symbol right to the browser.

Type the file name  and enter the respective code into it.


### Step 2:
Now compile the CheckPalindrome.sol file,

### Step 3:
Once compiled successfully, click “Deploy and run transactions”. and "Deploy" it ,

### Step 4:
Click “>” before your contract you will see a button palindrome below as the contract has palindrome function that returns 1 if number palindrome and 0 if it's not. 

Enter any number and click the palindrome button and you will get the output :

Now, we have successfully run the another smart contract in solidity.
